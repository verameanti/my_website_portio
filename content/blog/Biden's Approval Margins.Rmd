As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate),
         startdate = mdy(startdate),
         enddate = mdy(enddate),
         createddate = mdy(createddate),
         timestamp = hms(timestamp))

glimpse(approval_polllist)
skim(approval_polllist)
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:
```{r}
# Calculate the weekly net approval rate, along with sample size and standard deviation
approval_byweek <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(net_approval = approve - disapprove,
         week = week(enddate),
         year = year(enddate)) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(net_approval_mean = mean(net_approval),
            n = n(),
            sd = sd(net_approval))

# Create the line plot with 95% confidence interval surrounding it
approval_byweek %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = net_approval_mean)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = net_approval_mean - qt(0.975,df = n-1)*sd/sqrt(n),
              ymax = net_approval_mean + qt(0.975, df = n-1)*sd/sqrt(n)),
              fill = 'grey90',color = 'orangered') +
  geom_point(color = 'orange') +
  geom_line(color = 'orange') +
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=0),color = 'orange', size = 2) +
  labs(title = 'Estimating Weekly Net Approval Margin for Joe Biden',
       x = 'Week of Year 2021',
       y = 'Average Net Approval Margin(%)') +
  theme_bw()
  NULL
```


```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

Week 3 has an extremely large confidence interval whereas week 25 a very small one. This occurred likely because of the difference in sample sizes in the two weeks. On his first week, Biden received very few polls so there 95% confidence interval for the true approval rate is very large; on the other hand, he may have received a lot more polls on week 25 so the 95% confidence interval computed is much narrower.
