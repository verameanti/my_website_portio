## Find teachers, find students, encourage practice & have fun!

#### Poco a Poco is a platform that connects teachers & students, and encourages practice through achievements. 

When developing this service we found a **pain** in the sector: it was hard to 
stay motivated when learning an instrument, to find local teachers & to keep track of your progress and lessons. 

So we decided to **target** people that want to learn from local independent music teachers in their free time as well as the teachers themselves.

We started working on our **Database Schema**

Then created our **Figma prototype**

*Looking for teachers*

*Booking a class*

We coded using Ruby on Rails until we got the **final product**!
