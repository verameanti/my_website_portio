# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

#### For this analysis we will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)


```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data-csv", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

#### We imported, inspected, and cleaned the data to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?
```{r}
skim(movies)

```
There are no missing values in the dataset.

- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
```{r movie_count}
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(movie_count = n())

```

- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

```{r}
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(mean_gross = mean(gross),
            mean_budget = mean(budget)) %>% 
  mutate(return_on_budget = mean_gross / mean_budget) %>% 
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))
```

- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r}
movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(total_gross = sum(gross),
            mean_gross = mean(gross),
            median_gross = median(gross),
            sd_gross = sd(gross)) %>% 
  slice_max(total_gross, n=15) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_gross))
```


- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 

```{r rating_by_genres}

# Creating the variables
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
            min_rating = min(rating),
            max_rating = max(rating),
            median_rating = median(rating),
            sd_rating = sd(rating)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_rating))

# Making the overall histogram
ggplot(movies,aes(x=rating)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = 'Overall Ratings Distribution', 
       x= "Rating", 
       y="Number of ratings") + 
  theme_wsj()+ 
  scale_colour_wsj("colors6")

# Making histograms for each genre (free scale)
ggplot(movies,aes(x=rating)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~genre,scales = 'free') +
  labs(title = 'Ratings Distribution by Genre (free scale)',
       x= "Rating", 
       y="Number of ratings") +
  theme_wsj()+ 
  scale_colour_wsj("colors6")

# Making histograms for each genre (uniform scale)
ggplot(movies,aes(x=rating)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  labs(title = 'Ratings Distribution by Genre (uniform scale)',
       x= "Rating", 
       y="Number of ratings") +
  theme_tufte()
  NULL


```


## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?
  
  
```{r, gross_on_fblikes}

# Plotting the scatter plot
ggplot(movies,aes(x = cast_facebook_likes, y = gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = 'Cast Facebook Likes vs. Average Gross Earnings', 
       x= "Cast Facebook Likes", 
       y= "Average Gross Earnings") +
  theme_tufte()
  NULL
  
```
Cast_facebook_likes is used as the independent variable and placed on x-axis, whereas gross is to be predicted and placed on y-axis as dependent variables. We can see that the line of best fit suggests that there is a positive correlation between the two variables when the facebook likes are low. However, this relationship is very **insignificant** and it is inverted after facebook likes exceeds around 300,000, potentially due to presence of outliers with high facebook likes but low gross. Overall facebook likes is not a great predictor for gross.

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r, gross_on_budget}

# Plotting the scatter plot
ggplot(movies,aes(x = budget, y = gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = 'Budget vs. Average Gross Earnings',
       x= "Budget",
       y= " Average Gross Earnings") +
   theme_tufte()
  NULL

```
We observe a **relatively strong** positive correlation between the budget and gross of movies. Budget is not the perfect predictor but can predict the gross to a degree.

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r, gross_on_rating}

# Plotting multiple scatter plots by genre
ggplot(movies,aes(x = rating, y = gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  labs(title = 'Ratings vs. Gross by Genre',
       x="Ratings",
       y="Average Gross Earnings") +
  theme_tufte()
  
  NULL
```
We observe a decent level of positive correlation between rating and gross for most genres with sufficient data points. Thus, rating is a decent predictor to predict the gross of movies overall. However, there are quite a number of genres with insufficient data points and there is one strange thing: the documentary genre shows a negative relationship between rating and gross.
